            First of all, Happy Anniversary+1 month sayang <3
            <br><br>
            Meeting you was one of the best things that ever happened to me. You came into my life during a very strange phase; I was in chaos—and I still am to some extent. I know how hard it is for you to handle, and I truly appreciate you for putting up with me. I always say that I’m working on it, but honestly, I’m not sure if I’ve improved at all.
            <br><br>
            It’s so corny for me to say that I know you are the one for me, this being my first relationship. But I just don’t want anyone else, if it’s not you.
            <br><br>
            I love you, sayang. I have never felt this way toward anyone else, and I never imagined I would want to live a long life just to be with someone. So please, I beg you to stay healthy and stay with me for a long time.
            <br><br>
            I get so excited planning our future together, and I can't wait to make them all come true with you.
            <br><br>
            Yours truly,
            <br><br>
